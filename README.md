# sql-challenge

This repository contains my submission for the Module 9 sql-challenge. To complete this challenge I used quickDBD and pgAdmin4. In the output, you will find a png file of my quickDBD output, as well as SQL files containing the code used to create the tables and the code used for the queries.
